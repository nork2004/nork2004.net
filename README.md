## about
nork2004 is a personal website hosted on neocities, created by nork to dump their sillay passions and talent into. all code is hand-made by nork :-)
- i code using [phcode.dev](https://phcode.dev/) and sometimes [codebeautify.org](https://codebeautify.org/real-time-html-editor#). both for real-time editing
- site looks better on chrome desktop
- i used this [deploy to neocities](https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template) guide to upload and show contributions of my site!
- a queer coded this site

## extra

- im still learning HTML & CSS as i go on, so things might be wonky. but i do these things for fun so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
